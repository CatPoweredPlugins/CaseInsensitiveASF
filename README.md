# ASF Case Insensitive Bot Names Plugin
Plugin for [ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/) that makes bot names case-insensitive, so you can use `BotName`, `botname`, and `BoTnAmE` to refer to your bot. Also works for regular expressions in bot names.
Make sure you don't have multiple bots with names that differ only by case (only applicable to case-sensitive file systems of course). If you have two files `BotName.json` and `botname.json` in your config folder - you are guaranteed to have troubles.

## Installation
- download `CaseInsensitiveASF.zip` file from [latest release](https://github.com/Ryzhehvost/Case-Insensitive-ASF/releases/latest)
- create new folder called `CaseInsensitiveASF` inside of `plugins` folder in your ASF installation.
- unpack downloaded .zip file to newly created folder.
- (re)start ASF, you should get a message indicating that plugin loaded successfully.
